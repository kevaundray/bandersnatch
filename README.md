bandersnatch-rust
------


This is a reference implementation of [Bendersnatch curve](https://ethresear.ch/t/introducing-bandersnatch-a-fast-elliptic-curve-built-over-the-bls12-381-scalar-field/9957) using [Arkwork](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/curves)'s framework in Rust.
The spec of the curve is available 
[here](https://github.com/asanso/Bandersnatch/blob/main/README.md).
There was also a Python reference implementation [here](https://github.com/asanso/Bandersnatch/).
